    Spread of parapoxvirus
   
   Red squirrels are in decline in the UK and as such there is a considerable 
   effort to save them. However, a disease called parapoxvirus is especially 
   perilous to them. A group of biologists are investigating the spread of 
   the disease through the squirrel population.
 
   Based on the model given by the biologists, the current programme was
   created to simulate the red squirrel's environment. The programme has been 
   parallelised using the actor pattern.	
 
   To compile the code the Makefile provided should be used
   To run the program, after compiling (make) you should run the command make run
   To run the program in a back end of a server a sample .pbs file is provided
